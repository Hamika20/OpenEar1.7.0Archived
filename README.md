This is a preserved copy of OPEN EAR 1.7, a software-defined radio (SDR) utility that was previously removed from the web. 
Whether you're an RF enthusiast, hacker, or just someone who loves tinkering with signals, this tool gives you the power to explore the radio spectrum in ways most software won't.

Original project by chaoyi996, archived for preservation.
